User Input
1. Drawing
2. Word

Output
Intracte layerd SVG.

When users vist my site I am requesting user input in two forms: a drawing made directly on the screen using their mouse or trackpad and a word. This input combination enables me to generated a intricate layered SVGs.

What I like about this is that the user is in control of somthing unpredicatable, so through an iterative approach of drawing and text input there is a series of images produced. I find it both satisfying and fustrating as I cant quite pin down why some images 'work' and others don't. I'm asking the user/viewer to enage in that question too. 

Colours are selected based on a restricted pallet and an algorythm based on the letter used for the layer and the coords of the first  

A gallery page seems like a good idea :-)
