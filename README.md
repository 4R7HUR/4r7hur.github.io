Output Intracte layerd SVG.

When users vist my site I am requesting user input in two forms: a drawing made directly on the screen using their mouse or trackpad and a word [any word]. This input combination enables me to generated a intricate layered SVGs.

What I like about this is that the user is in control of somthing unpredicatable, so through an iterative approach of drawing and text input there is a series of images produced. I find it both satisfying and fustrating as I cant quite pin down why some images 'work' and others don't. I'm asking the user/viewer to enage in that question too.

Colours are selected based on a restricted pallet and an algorythm based on the letter used for the layer and the coords of the first

A gallery page seems like a good idea :-)

aeiou, white shapes


all keyboard functions should have the following variables avaialble to them

thirds //comment here
coordinate_arrays //comment here
    console.log(key);
    console.log(svgContainer);
    console.log(coordinate_arrays);
    console.log(thirds);
    console.log(svg_width);
    console.log(svg_height);
